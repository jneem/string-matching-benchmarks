string-matching-benchmarks
==========================

This crate implements benchmarks for various string-matching algorithms.
Currently, the benchmarks mostly consist of looking for words in the complete
works of Mark Twain, and they compare the performance of the
[wu-manber](https://github.com/jneem/wu-manber) and
[aho-corasick](https://github.com/BurntSushi/aho-corasick) crates.
